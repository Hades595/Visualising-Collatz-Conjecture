# This is a simple visualisation of the Collatz Conjecture Problem.

- If it is an odd number: 
      We multiple by 3 and add 1

- If it is an even number: 
      We divide by 2

We keep applying these rules, until we reach a loop of 4 -> 2 -> 1

Every positive number will end up in the 4,2,1 loop. 

So far this is the result I have gotten:
